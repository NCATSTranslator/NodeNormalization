"""Checks on the links in our documentation and in the endpoint descriptions.

Ported from NameResolution's tests/test_docs_links.py, so the two services enforce the same
rules. Keep them in sync when either changes.

Everything here is offline: it resolves relative paths and heading anchors on disk and
greps for a banned URL form. Nothing fetches a URL, because a test that fails when
GitHub is slow is a test people learn to ignore.
